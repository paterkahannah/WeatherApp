If you would like to interact with the WeatherMap you will need to download this repo to you own machine.
Then go to https://openweathermap.org/api, create and account and make your own api key https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.
Copy and paste your unique key into the keys.js file on line 7 inside the single quotes for the OPEN_WEATHER_APPID const.
THEN EXPERIENCE THE MAP!
